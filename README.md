## Contributing
Pull requests aren't welcome. You'll make this model unethical.

## License
This model is free (both as in beer and as in speech) and open source,
licensed under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
I don't even include limitations of warranty and liability,
because the model is so good that it doesn't need them.

In fact, I give a money-back guarantee: If you can find a single instance of this
model being unethical, I'll give you a full refund, and another free copy of the model.

I cannot be liable for any damages you may suffer from using this model, because
it's so good that it cannot possibly cause any damage, except perhaps the unemployment
of all ethics experts by replacing them. Any ethics experts out of a job will be compensated
with a free copy of this model.
